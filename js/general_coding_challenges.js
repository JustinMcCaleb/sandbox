    A narcissistic number is a non-negative integer (n) with m digits where the sum of all the individual digits raised to the power m is equal to n.

        For example:
            If n is 153, then m (the number of digits) is 3 and:

            1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

            So, 153 is a narcissistic number.

            Objective: Write a script to generate and output the first 25 narcissistic integers.
